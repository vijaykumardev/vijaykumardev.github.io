      <h2>In a nutshell</h2>
      <p>I am passionate about developing computer programs that eliminate mundane task by exploring software solutions for known and unknown problems from past experience and by acquiring new knowledge through learning and practice.</p>
      <p>I Graduated from master's in computer science department at Kansas State University on August 2018. In my academic program, I have concentrated on gaining knowledge on data handling from the traditional relational database and to storage-retrieval of big data in NoSQL based databases. And also concentrated on effective usage of employing programming paradigm such as imperative, functional, object-oriented, procedural and logical to build the application. As a Masterâ€™s project, I built an automatic SQL grader web application in Node.js that evaluates the academic assignments of relational database queries.</p>
      <p>With professional industry experience as a Java and Database developer at Tech Mahindra Ltd. for a data migration project for 3 years, I worked in a project that migrates customer billing account details from legacy systems to new stacks using ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) technique. In the project, I contributed in extending existing functionality to handle new billing account type, catalyzing migration by automating using java, shell script and PLSQL in scheduling, error notification, file processing and external component interaction.</p>
      <p>I believe analytical, problem-solving, debugging, studious, communication and learning from mistakes are the skills essential for a programmer to build a programming project successfully. I harness and endow in developing these skills.</p>

        <p>
          As a master's student, I focused on learning database systems by taking courses like Database Management System, Big Data, Text mining, and Information Retrieval. I enhanced my knowledge in software development with courses like Software Engineering, Software Security, Programming languages, Formal Language and Theory. My Master's final project was implemented with the knowledge I gained in the coursework by building a web application using Node.js, that will validate the SQL query submitted by students for automatic grading, which validates query using a SQL parser built in JavaScript.
